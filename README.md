## Introduction

The project was born aiming to develop my technical skills in front-end development while telling a bit about myself and my experiences.

<br>

Developed using React and Next.js (`create-next-app`).  
The following third-party packages were used:

- [firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Run locally

To run the development server, clone the repo, install the packagens present in `package.json` and run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to see the result.

> NOTE: You will need a few `.env` variables to run the backend. Check the API folder.
